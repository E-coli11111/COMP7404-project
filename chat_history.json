What we should do for the first step?.\nTo determine the total number of classes, we first need to identify the table that contains class information. We can do this by querying the database schema to find tables and their columns. \n\nLet's start by listing all the tables in the database. \n\n```sql\nSHOW TABLES;\n```\nNow we execute the SQL query and get the result. The result is a table with the following columns: \n\n|    |   # | Tables_in_test   |\n|---:|----:|:-----------------|\n|  0 |   1 | customers        |\n|  1 |   2 | inventory        |\n|  2 |   3 | order_items      |\n|  3 |   4 | orders           |\n|  4 |   5 | products         |\n\nIf this result useful? If so, what is the next step? If not, can you rework on it.\nThe result is not useful. It shows that there isn't any table named `class` in the database. It seems that the database schema does not contain a table specifically for classes. User may need to clarify what they mean by 'class'. \n\nEnd.\n\nPlease use the above information to help you understand the problem better.\nNow, let's think step by step.
